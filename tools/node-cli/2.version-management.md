# Node version management with n

We will be using [n](https://github.com/tj/n) for Node version management

## Basic n commands

```commandline
n latest
```

This will install the latest version of node

```commandline
n lts
```

This will install the latest _stable_ version of node.

Switching between these node versions you can:

```commandline
n current
```

This will switch to latest version.

```commandline
n stable
```

This will switch your node version to the LTS version.

We can also just run

```commandline
n
```

To get a list of versions and be able to select which one we can to switch to.

> The _latest_ version is the latest version with breaking API changes and all the new features, whereas the _lts_ version is the stable version without any breaking API changes

##Â Why the need for node version management?

Node version managment tools make it easy to keep track of the versions we are using and switch between them.

In some cases we might want to use the newest Node tooling, in which case we can switch to the new version within the scope of our existing project.
