##Â Running node scripts in the terminal

If we have an `index.js` file with the following:

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

We know that we can invoke the node runtime to run this script with `node index.js`. But ideally we want to be able to run this as it's own shell command without invoking the node runtime.

To do this we need to add a [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) to the top of our file:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

This tells shell to run the script using node and that index.js should always be executed using node when run in the terminal.

This allows us to run

```commandline
./index.js
```

And receive no errors. But what if we want to just run `jezl` to run the CLI?

We can define this in our `package.json` using `bin` and defining our script name and script in an object like so:

```json
{
  "name": "jezl",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": {
    "jezl": "index.js"
  }
}
```

We then run:

```commandline
npm link
```

Which installs the package globally in our machine.

Now if we run

```commandline
jezl
```

We will get our name output.

We can also publish this to npm, and download and run the script using `npx jezl`.
