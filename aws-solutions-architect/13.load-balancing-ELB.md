# Load balancing with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) 

Load balancing refers to distributing user traffic to multiple instances. 

A load balancer sits in front of your instances and distibutes traffic depending on instance load. 

This diagram explains it well:

## Why?

- Spreads load
- Single point of access using DNS
- Failure handling
- Load balancers can check health of instances
    - Load balancers check if downstream server will reply to requests
- HTTPS support
- High availability
- Can separate public and private traffic

## Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

Managed service that AWS maintains. No need to configure it yourself. Integrates with:

- EC2, EC2 auto scaling groups, ECS
- AWS Cert Manager, CloudWatch
- Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

### ELB types

Different generation of EBS:

1. Classic Load Balancer (old gen)
2. Application Load Balancer (v2)
3. Network Load Balancer (v2 new gen)
4. Gateway Load Balancer - 2020 and newest

Load balancers will allow access from anywhere, but the connection betweem EBS and EC2 instances is managed through security groups so EC2 access is restricted. 

## Load balancer types

> It's important to note that ELB is the overall service, but there are different types of load balancers for different purposes, as noted below 

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

This load balancer works at the HTTP level and allows for:

- HTTP load balancing
- Container load balancing
- HTTP/2 and WebSocket
- Redirects (HTTP > HTTPS)

Load balancing can be based on:

- Path based. /users or /posts for e.g
- Hostname (subdomains, for e.g)
- Query strings and headers

> ALB is good for microservices where you want to balance load between services and each service might hit a different endpoint, subdomain, container etc

## Target groups

Path routing, for example, determines which target group (a set of resources) to route request to. Target groups can be:

- EC2 instances
- ECS tasks
- Lambda functions
- IP addresses

For example query param target group routing:

## Good to know:

- ALBs get a fixed hostname
- App servers don't see client IP directly, instead it's passed through headers
