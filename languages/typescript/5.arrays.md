# Typescript Array[] types

Arrays in Typescript involve using array bracket `[]` after the type declaration:

```ts
const listOfNames:string[] = ["Jimmy", "Alex", "Doyle]
```

We can then `push`, `pop` and do other operations on the array like normal.

Something to note is that if we use the following syntax to initialise an array:

```ts
const activeUser: [] = [];
```

And try and do anything with this array:

```ts
activeUsers.push("Steven"); // 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'
```

TS will complain, this is because it thinks we have declated an array type of empty. So no operations on that array will be allowed.

> This is one of the situations where we definitely annotate a variable, instead of letting TS infer the type. TS will infer that it is an array, but won't know what types should be included in the array

## Array<> alternative arrow syntax

There is an alternative array syntax using arrows:

```ts
const activeUsers: Array<string> = [];
```

## Non primitive Array values

TS arrays aren't limited to primitives, you can also use type definitions like so:

```ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

const coords: Point[] = [
  { x: 10, y: 2 },
  { x: -0.1, y: 20 },
];
```

Here `coords` is an array of `Point` objects.

## Multidimensional arrays

Arrays of > 1 dimensions are defined using additional brackets:

```ts
const multiDimensional: string[][] = [["Hello"], ["world"]];
```

## Using Arrays as function params

Here is an example of defining a type and then using it to define an arrays of the type as a function argument:

```ts
type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
};

function getTotal(products: Product[]): number {
  return products.reduce((accumulator, item) => {
    return (accumulator += item.price);
  }, 0);
}

const theTotal = getTotal([
  {
    name: "yellow toy",
    price: 100,
  },
  {
    name: "blue toy",
    price: 20,
  },
]);
```
