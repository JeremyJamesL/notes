# Tuples in Typescript

Tuples are unique and exist in Typescript, but not in Javascript.

They are arrays of fixed lengths and types, you can think of them as rigidly defined arrays.

```ts
const colour: [number, number, number] = [234, 22, 55]; // An array with three numbers will be valid
const colour: [number, number, number] = [234, 22, 55, 0.6]; // This will throw an erorr: Source has 4 element(s) but target allows only 3
```

The syntax is still array bracket notation `[]`, but you define the type and length of the array, so above we have an array that is 3 elements long and each of which are a number.

Take another example:

```ts
type HTTPResponse: [number, string]
const httpOK: HTTPResponse = [200, "OK"] // Valid
const httpERROR: HTTPResponse = ["ERROR", 404] // Invalid as we have a string in place of a number
```

> Tuples don't prevent you doing pop, push etc operations on array, which is counter intuitive and a limitation of tuples.
